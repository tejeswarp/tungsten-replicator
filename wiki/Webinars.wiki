== Breaking the Cross-Site Data Barrier: Tungsten Multi-Master Replication for MySQL ==

Multi-master replication between sites is the holy grail of applications ranging from credit card processing to large-scale software-as-a-service (SaaS) operations. Tungsten Replicator is award-winning open source software that helps you solve a wide range of multi-master problems that you can only dream of tackling with MySQL native replication.

Learn the nuts and bolts of multi-master replication using Tungsten.  We explain the architecture and demonstrate setup of solutions to common multi-master problems such as:

  * Aggregating MySQL data from multiple sites into a single MySQL DBMS for reporting
  * Cross site replication between 2, 3 or more masters
  * Supporting SaaS customers on multiple sites using system-of-record and sharding.

Along the way we cover practical issues like provisioning new servers, data conflicts, and failure recovery. After this webinar you'll be a multi-master guru ready to tackle the tough cross-site problems with verve and aplomb.
